    <p style="margin-top: -350px; margin-left: 33%;">Mount Everest (Nepali: सगरमाथा, romanized: Sagarmāthā; Tibetan: Chomolungma ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ;
         Chinese: 珠穆朗玛峰; pinyin: Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, 
         located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its 
         summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 8+1⁄2 in) was most recently established 
         in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]
         Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. 
         There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal 
         (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical
          climbing challenges on the standard route,
  
        
         
         Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards
          from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall. As of November 2022, 310 people have died on Everest.
           Over 200 bodies remain on the mountain and have not been removed due to the dangerous conditions.[5][6]
           The first recorded efforts to reach Everest's summit were made by British mountaineers.
            As Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time, the British made several 
            attempts on the north ridge route from the Tibetan side. After the first reconnaissance expedition by the 
            British in 1921 reached 7,000 m (22,970 ft) on the North Col, the 1922 expedition pushed the north ridge route up to 8,
            320 m (27,300 ft), marking the first time a human had climbed above 8,000 m (26,247 ft). The 1924 expedition resulted
             in one of the greatest mysteries on Everest to this day: George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made a final summit attempt
              on 8 June but never returned, sparking debate as to whether they were the first to reach the top. Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary made the 
              first documented ascent of Everest in 1953, using the southeast ridge route. Norgay had reached 8,595 m (28,199 ft) the previous year as a member 
              of the 1952 Swiss expedition. The Chinese mountaineering team of Wang Fuzhou, Gonpo, and Qu Yinhua made the first reported ascent
            of the peak from the north ridge on 25 May 1960.[7] The Tibetan name for Everest is Qomolangma (ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ, lit. "Holy Mother").
             The name was first recorded with a Chinese transcription on the 1721 Kangxi Atlas during the reign of Emperor Kangxi of Qing China, 
             and then appeared as Tchoumour Lancma on a 1733 map published in Paris by the French geographer D'Anville based on the former map.[8] 
             The Tibetan name is also popularly romanised as Chomolungma and (in Wylie) as Jo-mo-glang-ma.[13]

            The official Chinese transcription is 珠穆朗玛峰 (t 珠穆朗瑪峰), whose pinyin form is Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng. While other Chinese names were used,
             including Shèngmǔ Fēng (t 聖母峰, s 圣母峰, lit. "Holy Mother Peak"), these names were largely phased out when the Ministry of Internal Affairs of China 
             issued a decree to adopt a sole name in May 1952.[14]
           
            
            Other documented local names include "Deodungha" ("Holy Mountain"), but it is unclear whether it is commonly used.[15]
            
            In 1849, the British survey wanted to preserve local names if possible (e.g., Kangchenjunga and Dhaulagiri), and Andrew Waugh,
             the British Surveyor General of India, argued that he could not find any commonly used local name, as his search for a local name was hampered by Nepal's 
             and Tibet's exclusion of foreigners. Waugh argued that because there were many local names, it would be difficult to favour one name over all others;
              he decided that Peak XV should be named after British surveyor Sir George Everest, his predecessor as Surveyor General of India.[16][17][18] 
              Everest himself opposed the name suggested by Waugh and told the Royal Geographical Society in 1857 that "Everest" could not be written in Hindi nor 
              pronounced by "the native of India". Waugh's proposed name prevailed despite the objections, and in 1865, the Royal Geographical Society officially
               adopted Mount Everest as the name for the highest mountain in the world.[16][19] The modern pronunciation of Everest</p>

                In 1856, Andrew Waugh announced Everest (then known as Peak XV) as 8,840 m (29,002 ft) high,
                 after several years of calculations based on observations made by the Great Trigonometrical Survey.[31]
                  From 1952 to 1954, the Survey of India, using triangulation methods, determined that the height of Everest was 8,847.73 m 
                  (29,028 ft).[32] In 1975 it was subsequently reaffirmed by a Chinese measurement of 8,848.13 m (29,029.30 ft).[33] 
                  In both cases the snow cap, not the rock head, was measured. The 8,848 m (29,029 ft) height given was officially recognised by Nepal and China.[34] Nepal planned a new survey in 2019 to determine if the April 2015 Nepal earthquake affected the height of the mountain.[35]

                In May 1999, an American Everest expedition directed by Bradford Washburn anchored a GPS unit into the highest bedrock. 
                A rock head elevation of 8,850 m (29,035 ft), and a snow/ice elevation 1 m (3 ft) higher, were obtained via this device.[36] 
                
                Although as of 2001, it has not been officially recognised by Nepal,[37] this figure is widely quoted. Geoid uncertainty casts 
                doubt upon the accuracy claimed by both the 1999 and 2005 (see § 21st-century surveys) surveys.[38]
                
                In 1955, a detailed photogrammetric map (at a scale of 1:50,000) of the Khumbu region, including the south side of Mount Everest,
                 was made by Erwin Schneider as part of the 1955 International Himalayan Expedition, which also attempted Lhotse.
                
                In the late 1980s, an even more detailed topographic map of the Everest area was made under the direction of Bradford Washburn,
                 using extensive aerial photography.[39]
